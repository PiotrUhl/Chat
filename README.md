## Communication protocol
Application is using its own communication protocol based on raw TCP protokol. Messages are divided into two groups: request from clients to server and answers from server to client. Every message is stared with control byte, determining its type.
#### Syntax:
- Message name (size_of_segment name of segment) *(size_of_segment name of segment sent one or more times)*\* - description of message
  - Answer name (size_of_segment name of segment) (size_of_segment name of segment) - description of answer
- Check (1B type)(4B SenderId) (8B MessageId) - checks if there are any messages newer than *MessageId* for client *SenderId*
  - CheckNoNew (1B type) - no new messages
  - CheckNew (1B type) (n\*4B ClientsIds) - new messages from *ClientsIds* available
- GetNew (1B type) (4B Client1Id ) (4B Client2Id) (8B MessageId) (1B limit) - gets *limit* newest messages, newer than *MessageId* between *Client1Id* and *Client2Id*
  - Get (1B type) *((1B ControlByte1) (8B MessageId) (nB Message) (1B '\0'))*\* - *ControlByte1* 1 means message is sent, 3 means recieved; message text is terminated with null character, next byte after null determines if next message (1 or 3) or end; *ControlByte2* 0 means no more messages, 4 means more messages pending
- New (1B type) (4B Client1Id) (4B Client2Id) (nB Message) - sends new message from *Client1Id* to *Client2Id* 
  - New (1B type) (4B Client1Id) (4B Client2Id) (8B MessageId) - new message *MessageId* sent from *Client1Id* to *Client2Id* 
- Read (1B type) (8B MessageId) - marks *MessageId* as read
  - Read (1B type) - response, does nothing
- GetClient (1B type) (4B ClientId) - gets display name of *ClientId*
  - GetClient (1B type) (nB ClientName) - requested *ClientName*
- LogIn (1B type) (32B PassHash) (nB Login) - tries to login as user with *Login* and *PassHash*
  - (LogIn 1B type) (4B ClientId) - id of logged client if succes, -1 if not
